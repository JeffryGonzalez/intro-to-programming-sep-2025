# Plan

(I'm muted - just give me minute.)

1. Show some miscellaneous syntax stuff.
    - More OOP
        - Properties
        - Methods and Method Overloading
        - Records
    - Delegates (`() =>` functions.)
2. Look briefly at the LinksApi and show some of the stuff we've covered.
3. At about ~3:00 - send you on your own. Or hang out with me and ask stuff or chat.
